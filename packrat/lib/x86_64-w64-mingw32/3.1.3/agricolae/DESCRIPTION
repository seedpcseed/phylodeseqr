Description: Agricolae was presented in the thesis "A statistical
    analysis tool for agricultural research" to obtain the degree of
    Master on science, mention Systems Engineering, Faculty of
    Industrial and Systems Engineering, National Engineering University

    CIP (International Potato Center). Agricolae offers extensive
    functionality on experimental design especially for agricultural
    and plant breeding experiments, which can also be useful for other
    purposes. It supports planning of lattice, Alpha, Cyclic, Complete
    Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin Squares, augmented block,
    factorial, split and strip plot designs. There are also various
